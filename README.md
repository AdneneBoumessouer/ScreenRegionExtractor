# Computer Vision based Extraction of LCD-Region of Digital Electric Meters for Digit Recognition

# Abstract
This repository describes a simple computer vision based method to extract the LCD screen region from real-world images of smart energy/electricity meters. It is a preliminary preprocessing step in an image processing pipeline which aims at performing seven-segment digit recognition.
